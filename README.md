# CleanSigPatch
 Create a minimal package with just sigpatches.

NOTE:  
Now you can add https://github.com/abelmarkus/CleanSigPatch/releases/latest/download/CleanSigPatch.zip to your favorite homebrew updater  
(I created a new 'custom download' into AIO Switch Updater and it works like a charm!)

And That's It!
